#  Python Practice: Mastering the Fundamentals & OOP

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  
I'm **NauRaa**, and this repository is a complete collection of my Python practice files.  
It documents my full journey from learning the basics to mastering advanced concepts â€” especially Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

---

##  Purpose of This Repository

This repository is my personal learning log where I:
- Reviewed all Python fundamentals thoroughly.
- Practiced real coding problems and challenges.
- Built a deep understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming**.
- Tracked my growth in problem-solving and logical thinking.

---

## Topics Covered

###  Python Core Fundamentals:
Iâ€™ve carefully reviewed and practiced the following:

- Variables and Data Types
- Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, and Bitwise Operators
- String operations and formatting
- Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
- Conditional statements (if / elif / else)
- Loops (for, while, nested, else in loops, break/continue/pass)
- Functions (with parameters, return, *args, **kwargs)
- Scope (Global vs Local)
- Lambda Expressions
- Recursion
- Input / Output
- Boolean Logic
- Packing and Unpacking
- Type Hinting
- Built-in Functions
- Modules
- Date and Time
- Iterators and Generators
- File Handling (read, write, append, etc.)
- Docstrings and Comments

---

###  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

I also reviewed and practiced all main OOP concepts in Python:

- Defining Classes and Objects
- Instance Attributes and Methods
- Class Attributes
- Static Methods
- Class Methods
- Inheritance (Single and Multiple)
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Method Overriding
- Magic Methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`, `__eq__`, etc.)
- Operator Overloading
- Practical OOP Challenges

---

##  Current Focus

- Applying OOP in real-world problems.
- Solving complex logic and problem-solving challenges.
- Improving code structure and readability.
- Preparing for building complete Python projects.

---

##  Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- No external libraries required (except for a few optional experiments)

---

##  Notes

- Every line of code here is written by me with full understanding and intent.
- This is a live file that grows with my skills â€” I revisit and improve my code often.
- Feel free to explore the code or suggest improvements and still learning ... ðŸ’¬
